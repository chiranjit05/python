 # REFER NOTES

#Create one conditional to find whether “false” is in string str1. If so, assign variable output the string “False. 
#You aren’t you?”. Check to see if “true” is in string str1 and if it is then assign “True! You are you!” to the variable 
#output. If neither are in str1, assign “Neither true nor false!” to output.

# METHOD 1 :

str1 = "Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!"

if("false" in str1):
    output = "False. You aren’t you?"
else :
    if ("true" in str1) :
        output = "True! You are you!"
    else : 
        output = "Neither true nor false!"
        
print(output)

# method 2 :

str1 = "Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!"

if("false" in str1):
    output = "False. You aren’t you?"
elif ("true" in str1) :
    output = "True! You are you!"
else :
